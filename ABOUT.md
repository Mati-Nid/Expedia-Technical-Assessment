# Hi

This is a Hotel deals site developed as the technical assessment task for Expedia, The Site consumes an API provided by Expedia as a server-side call and displays deals as required by the task.

The application is developed as a first step assessment in the hiring process at the company in the hopes it will lead to the next step :)

## Development Process

Development Language : C#
Development Framework : ASP.Net core
IDE : Visual studio 2017

Recently, I have been working as a software engineer in a small Jordanian company , my responsibilities include mainly developing C# desktop solutions and extension, windows services, and web APIs.

I chose C# and ASP.Net as I am most experienced and comfortable working with them at the moment. However, I do not have much experience in web development (front end in particular) but I was able to recall basics and important aspects quickly since I had my university training on web development.

## Challenges

1. Front end development, I usually work on back end, desktop apps and layout algorithm, the change to front end was challenging.
2. lack of .NET support on Heroku, to overcome this i had to deploy the site using a docker.
